# 📖 Voyage de MOOCs
❤️ **What**: I love online learning; it feeds my curiosity and gives me the joy of exploration with freedom. I started my MOOC journey back in 2013 on Edx with Harvard's famous course called [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/). Ever since, I have taken many courses spanning many diverse fields. This repo contains relevant material about the MOOC I have taken.


🗄️ **Why this Repo**: A few years ago, I found that I could learn more efficiently by taking notes and sharing my progress. As I later found out, this personal finding is backed by science. In the book "[Willpower](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11104933-willpower)", social psychologist Baumeister wrote extensively about the power of tracking progress, pre-commitment, and writing. Following this, I have started taking notes and recording my progress. 

⚙️ **My Learning Mechanism**: There are two often-cited styles of learning: i) by reading books or taking courses and solving exercises, ii) directly delving into a related project or a problem, and learning by doing. We can think of these two as supervised (more structured feedback) and unsupervised (you have to create your structure and signal) learning. However, I think that a combination of these two -- pre-training on courses/books and fine-tuning on projects/tasks -- is the more optimal solution.

This combination consists of two steps. Start by taking/reading a few relevant courses/books quickly, and the aim is to complete the course/book as soon as possible. Start working on a project once I'm familiar with its basics. Then, I will keep revisiting it as I do more work on the project. For instance, I want to draw new types of plots for a paper, and I am trying to figure out how. I would start by reading Matplotlib documentation or taking a small MOOC (along with playing with some toy examples) and then move on to the task at hand.
