# üìñ Voyage de MOOCs
‚ù§Ô∏è **What**: I love online learning: it feeds my curiosity and gives me the joy of exploration with freedom. I started my MOOC journey back in 2013 on Edx with Harvard's famous course [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/). Ever since I have taken many courses spanning many diverse fields. This repo contains all-things MOOCs.


üóÑÔ∏è **Why this Repo**: A few years ago, I [found that by writing and sharing my progress, I can do things more efficentiy](http://awaisrauf.github.io/deepCuriosity/AI-RoadMap). This personal finding, as I later found out, is backed by science. In the book "[Willpower](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11104933-willpower)", social psychologist Baumeister wrote extensively about the power of tracking progress, pre-commitment, and writing. Following this, I have started taking notes and recording my progress. 

‚öôÔ∏è **My Learning Mechanism**: There are two often-cited styles of learning: i) by reading books or taking courses and solving exercises ii) directly delving into a related project or a problem and learning by doing. We can think of these two as supervised (more structured and have supervised signal for success or failure) and unsupervised (you have to create your structure and signal) learning. However, I think that a thoughtful combination of both of these -- pre-training on courses/books and fine-tuning on proeject/tasks -- is more optimal solution.

This combination consists of two steps. Start by taking/reading a few relevant courses/books quickly. Your aim should be to complete the course/book as soon as possible. Start working on a project once you are done with it. The less you know about the field, the easier the course/book you should take/read. For instance, I want to draw a few plots for a paper and I have no idea how to do it. I would start by reading Matplotlib documentation or taking a small MOOC (along with writing some toy examples) and then will move on to the task at hand.
